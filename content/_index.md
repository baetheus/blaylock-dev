Hello,

I'm Brandon Blaylock and this is my personal website. Primarily, I write software, build tools, cook food, and read a lot of technical documents and novels.

Currently I am on a year long sabbatical from working as a software engineer. So far I have done some travelling, worked on a few open source projects, and done a good amount of reading and thinking about what I want out of my next job.

As far as projects go my current work is fleshing out a tool library for constructing correct type safe programs in TypeScript on the Deno runtime. That project is appropriately named [fun](https://github.com/nullpub/fun). Aside from fun I am reading through and taking notes on the xmpp rfcs with the intention of building client and server application in rust as my first production rust project.

You may contact me by sending an email to brandon at this domain. I'm not currently looking for work but will likely start reaching out to companies that I'm interested in come March 2022.

Thanks for reading and take care!
